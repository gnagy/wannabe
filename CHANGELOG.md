# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — unreleased

First version, used for one application's releases and test deployments.

- Commands: `gradle built` · `cleaned` · `tested` · `unit-tested`, `docker pushed`, `deployment pinned` ·
  `synced` · `pulled` · `running` · `ready` · `committed`, and the shortcuts `released` and `deployed`.
- Plugins looked up in the project's `.wannabe/plugins/`, then in wannabe's own.
- `wannatry` for dry runs, `wannado` as another name.
- Built-ins: `helped`, and `self installed` · `uninstalled` · `updated` · `completion` · `get` · `version`.
- zsh completion.
- Tests for dispatch, completion, compose editing and the deployment commands.
- Secrets: `.wannabe/secrets.yaml` names them and never holds them; a value comes from `WANNABE_SECRET_<NAME>`, the
  secret's own command, or the computer's secret store (Keychain, libsecret, Credential Manager, through
  `Bun.secrets`). `secret stored` · `checked` · `forgotten`, and `getSecret()` for plugins.
- `docker pushed` signs in to the registry named in `spec.registry` with two secrets, through a scratch Docker
  configuration for that push, instead of needing a Docker login on the computer.
